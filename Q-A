- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.

    - Headers can be requests or responses that pertain to what we are asking from the server. Examples:

- What happens when you type "http://somesite.com/some/page.html" in a browser?

    that one errors out, but I assume it's giving a demo in which case:

    1. It gets parsed/changed into an IP Address
    2. The browser makes a request to that IP address
    3. The server responds in the fomat requested
    4. The browser converts the response and pulls necessary resources
